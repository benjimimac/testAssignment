Object Oriented Programming

The aim of my assignment is to compare the top four European football leagues - The Premierleague, The Bundesliga, La Liga, and Serie A.
I will be comparing different stats over a ten year period, starting with the 2004/04 season up to the 2013/14 season.

Each file contains each leagues data, every single match that occurred over the ten years in the form:
home team,away team, homescore - away score

Two splits will have to be done on this data as the team names are separated by "," (commas) and the scores
are separated by "-" hyphons.

Each created object will store a teams record for a particular season which can be accessed using different loops.

Over the coming month I intend to create menus which can transition smoothly and give the user options to look at specific leagues, or teams, or 
allow the user to make comparisons and see which league has been the strongest over the ten year period. I intend to research different ways
of conveying the data and also different ways of presenting the menus.

I will be adding additional classes to the program, some of which use the extends keyword to show different home and away versions of each league also.
